# 🚀 My API Version 3 - The Final? Open Source Release  

Welcome to the last iteration of my API before a complete rewrite! This API has been running strong from **~2020 to 2025**, evolving over time with new features but very little removed.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some parts have been omitted for security reasons, but what's here should serve as a solid reference for anyone looking to learn from it.  

## 📖 About This Release  
- 🏗️ **Built over years** – A mix of old and new, with features stacked on top of each other.  
- 🔒 **Some things omitted** – Security first, but there’s still plenty to explore.  
- 📜 **Docs? Sort of…** – Some things are documented, others… well, good luck! 
- 🔥 **Callback Hell** – This API is *very much* trapped in callback hell. The next iteration will be rewritten in **TypeScript**, where things will (hopefully) be less of a mess.  

## 🌍 The Future: Zuxi Net  
This API isn’t my focus anymore—these days, I primarily use it for browser-based access. My new project, **Zuxi Net**, is a **TCP-based** system that does the same things however its way faster. Maybe I’ll open-source it someday, but for now, enjoy this.  

## ✌️ See You in 5 Years... Maybe  
I’ll be back with a **brand-new TypeScript rewrite** in the future. Until then, enjoy picking apart this relic from the past.
